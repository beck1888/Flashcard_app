# Project #3 Make Some Flash Cards

## Requirements

1. Create 20 flashcards. Each card has:

    - A text prompt that will be displayed to the user

    - A correct answer that can by typed in


2. Show the flashcards in a random order

    - Get user's response

    - Check if the response is correct


3. Use file I/O to keep track of user performance, e.g.

    - How many questions did the user get right vs wrong

    - Which questions did the user get right vs wrong

    - Use the user input data (performance or other text input) to change the way you show the flashcards. **You only have to choose one way to respond to user performance.** Here are some suggestions:

        - Show flashcards that a user got wrong more frequently than the ones they got right

        - Stop showing a flashcard once the user gets it right a certain number of times

        - Implement the The Leitner System

        - Let the user answer questions about how many flashcards they want to see, or which flashcards they want to see more frequently

        - Let the user choose from different flashcard decks

        - Let the user choose how many times they want to see each flash card, or what difficulty they want




## Extra credit options:

1. Have an option to display statistics on user performance.

2. Allow a user to "login" with a specific username, so different people can use your system and keep track of their results separately.

## EXTRA-extra-credit option:

1. Make a visual interface. Try exploring tkinter.
