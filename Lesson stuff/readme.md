# Development path

*Crossed out items are complete*

~~1. Make some ( >= 20) flashcard on anything and save them to a file (`cards.json`) as a dictionary structure~~
    - ~~Flashcard set 1 theme: All about Mac flashcards (assuming a shell of .zsh and an m1 13 inch MacBook Pro 2020)~~


~~2. Write some functions on `main.py` to:~~
    - ~~Pretty display output~~
    - ~~Easy way to deal with json~~
        - ~~Extract flashcard data~~
        - ~~Read/write flashcard stats~~

~~3. In `main.py` make a simple program to go through the cards~~

~~4. Start tracking correct/incorrect stats on all cards and save the data to `progress_tracking.json`~~

~~ 5. Implement multiple decks ~~
    ~~- Update other code accordingly to allow for multiple decks~~
    ~~- Deck 2: Spanish quiz~~
    ~~- **PLEASE NOTE:** we are now removing accents to store the words because of json conflicts with accented characters.~~

~~6. Allow user to select a flashcard deck~~

*Everything below this line is an add-on (not required in the assignment)*

~~7. ⭐️ Update the 'home screen' in `main.py` that allows user to see stats or start review~~

~~ 8. Implement text fuzzing to make sure 'close enough' answers are accepted (i.e. misspellings) ~~

~~9. Add sound effects with easy mute option~~

10. ⭐️ Use tkinter to build a UI

**Items with star emojis will earn extra credit as per `lesson.md`**
