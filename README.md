# Beck's Flashcard App

## Project overview
Goal: Design a flashcard app that shows a set of flashcards and and asks for the answer. Also, track how often the user gives a correct vs incorrect answer, and display these stats to the user.

## Progress

 - [x] Make 20 flashcards

 - [x] Check if the input is correct and save that data point to another file
 - [x] Create a second set of 20 flashcards
 - [x] Let the user pick a set
 - [x] Add a 'statistics' screen for each set
 - [x] Add sound effects
 - [x] Add a way to check if text close enough
 - [x] Make menus and format the display of content
 
## Possible/future add-ons
